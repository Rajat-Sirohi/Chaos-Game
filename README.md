# Chaos Game

The above programs are variations of the core simulation of a chaos game with differing rules and/or polygon sizes. For a good, accessible introduction to the procedure: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs&t=12s

I've included four specific implementations of the algorithm:

# ST\_10\_5
This variation produces the sierpinski triangle. The included animation utilizes a total number of particles, n = 10^5.

# SQ\_10\_5
This variation is an example of a restricted chaos game. Here, the current vertex cannot be 2 places away from the previous vertex, i.e. opposite vertex. The included animation utilizes a total number of particles, n = 10^5.

# PENT1\_10\_5
This variation is another example of a restricted chaos game. Here, the shape is a pentagon and the current vertex cannot be the same as the previous vertex. The included animation utilizes a total number of particles, n = 10^5.

# PENT2\_10\_5
This variation is another example of a restricted chaos game. Here, the shape is a pentagon and the current vertex cannot be 1 or 3 places away from the two previously chosen vertices respectively. The included animation utilizes a total number of particles, n = 10^5.
